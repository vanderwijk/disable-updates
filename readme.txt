== Description ==

This plugin disables all WordPress updates (core, plugins and themes). This can be useful if you have multiple environments such as a live and staging server and you don't want your users to use the update functionality.

This plugin not only disables the update mechanism for the core, plugins and themes, but it also removes the update menu item from the left navigation menu in the admin.

== Screenshots ==

2. After activating the plugin all update notices are disabled.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the zip file and upload the folder to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
